## Introduction
This study focuses on the application of the Single-Index Model (SIM) for analyzing
road traffic accident data. The goal is to understand the nonlinear relationships be-
tween accident rates and multiple predictors such as weather conditions, road types,
and traffic controls. By extending the traditional SIM to accommodate multinomial
response variables, this research aims to enhance predictive accuracy and provide ac-
tionable insights for improving road safety.
The choice of this assignment is motivated by the critical need to reduce road traffic
accidents and improve transportation safety. The primary analysis questions revolve
around identifying key predictors of road accidents, understanding their impact, and
evaluating high-risk areas. The challenge lies in managing complex, non-linear inter-
actions between multiple predictors and accident rates. Solving these problems is ex-
pected to contribute significantly to policy making and resource allocation, ultimately
reducing accidents and saving lives.
The Single-Index Model (SIM) is a semiparametric regression technique that simplifies
the analysis of complex datasets by reducing multiple predictors into a single index.
